Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
do you listen to this crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
She okay?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
You the new guy?
How many people were in your old school?
That I'm used to.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
What makes you think he'll do it?
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Assail your ears for one night.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Where ya goin?
Hey.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Who's that?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Pick you up Friday, then
Why 're you doing this?
Why?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Put your right foot there --
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
Why can't we agree on this?
As a parent, that's my right
Bianca did what?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What does he say?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
I am listening, my son.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I believed in you...
New worlds create new people.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Do they have such thoughts?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't say anything.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Are you married?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
I'll make some for us.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Who's there?
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Hmmmm.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Why not?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Okay.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Ready?
Are you married?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
In here, says he wants a million.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Get in the bathroom!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
New York.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
CONTINUED
Okay. 
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Well, that's something.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I am prepared to do that anyway.

When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What do you mean?
That's true
Name?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Pay money?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
You lying son of a bitch...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Well?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
There.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
No class...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
What about Luther?
We missed.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Yeah, I see her.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Hey, there she is...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Yeah...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
What the bell happened?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Bullshit red tape.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Hey, you're right.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Hey, I don't believe it.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Three more hours...
We got a lot to talk about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Let her go.
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
What're you laughing about?
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
They all like this in your family, father?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Hello?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
Six to the left. One to the right.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
...Shit!
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...Like love...
Tell me...
The cash man!
It's not?
This is all that survived?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Wait or act.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What happened to you?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Anything harder?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
You said something about money.
Excellent.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Alright, Tom.
I figured you share information.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Celebrity Films.
Yeah, who's this?
What?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Not quite.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
... Hello... ?
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
You're learning.
Wha... ?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.
Nothing remotely like this.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Hello... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Hello... ?
Do you know what happened to her?
No, sir, he is not.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
We'll figure it out.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What is it?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Is that who you're waiting for?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Where is he?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
Where are we going?
How was the meeting?
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
It's okay.
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
All ready?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Chub says you're fired.
I plan to. Soon.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Double A. New Britain.
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
No, I mean whereabouts.
Where'd you get the blood?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus, why?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Don't go playing policeman.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
On what you pay me?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
We should talk.
See. Get your boots.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
You don't mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Oh, Wade.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Going somewhere, Margie?
You're not using it today?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Get some sleep.
What about Margie?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
I don't drink coffee.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Uh, we got a problem here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Why?
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Stop.
The fax machines.
One.
Yeah, right.
Thank you for calling the white House...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
That's not possible.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You folks need any help?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Captain, how soon can we land?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I like my horizons narrow.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Who is he?
Your health...
I'm going home.
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
How potent?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Okay, let's do it.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'll go.
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That the atmosphere processor?
You son of a bitch.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can'
