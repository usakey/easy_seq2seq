Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Sure have.
She's not a...
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Well, no...
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
The "real you".
Wow
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
But
Why didn't you tell me?
That's not
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
I just wanted --
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
What if she never starts dating?
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
No, but
I'm missing something.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
So -- which Dakota you from?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Get out!
That girl -- I --
Who is she?
Why not?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
You makin' any headway?
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Hey -- do you mind?
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
A hundred bucks a date.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Nope - just came by to chat
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
He always look so
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
What's this?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William didn't even go to high school
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Are you following me?
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
What's this?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
You're not okay.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
You don't care if I die
Like you could find one
Why'd you let him get to you?
Dorsey.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Were you in jail?
No, you weren't
I should do this.
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Who?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Wholesome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The Partridge Family?
Good call.
A soft side? Who knew?
So what's your excuse?
Yes
Then you screwed up
You up for it?
State trooper?
The duck?
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
No.
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
You tell me.
Answer the question, Patrick
My grandmother's .
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
It wasn't like that.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Which parts?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Tempestuous?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
What plan?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
You were right. She's still pissed.
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Did I have anything to say about it?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
They took everything...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
How far from here?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
What are you listening to?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
No...
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
All I have to do is call the guards.
What do you see?
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
To bring the word of God.
... and also to bring medicine.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
Father Marchena!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Colon!
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
What are you saying?
How long?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
What do you read?
What's he doing?
Where can I meet this man?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
You must be mad...!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're lost!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You bloody...
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
I'm coming with you.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
...delusions and paranoia.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your mother was blind?
Back in the Czech Republic?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Now I become custody of police department?
I will if they don't send me back.
I can't take you to my place.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
Is he your boyfriend?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
What are you doing?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Who did cause and origin?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
I let her take a shower.
No!  Nothing happened.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
What was that, Korfin?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
I'm gonna propose.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Any I.D.?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
You know what that is, right?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, I musta missed it.
I don't even watch TV.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
What would you call her?
I'll come with you.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
Mind if I ride along with you?
I'll let you know what happens.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Two heads.
You thirsty?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
Yeah.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I'm serious here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
I kill someone famous.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
How many victims are up there?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Stop it.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay, til tonight.
You promise?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Okay.  You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
And what do you do with the bones?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
How much money are you carrying with you?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
We are both from Prague.
Two weeks.
Who is he?
This all you want?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
How you erase this?
Whore?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
What is it?
I did.
Why not?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You got that?
Traitor!!
Emil???!
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
We started over, you can too.
Robert...?
You've got a call.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
I know.
Well, he...
I'm trying to tell you.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
I speak English.
A cheap hotel.
I'm here for movies.
No.  Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll take him.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
I'll send a cop back for you.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
What??
What?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
How was it?
Get outta here!
What are you gonna do?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
It's about my salary cheques.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Really.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
Oh?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Yes, I thought so.
How?
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Good morning. How's it going?
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two more.
Hal?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess not.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Well, don't worry about it.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Are you coming to my party?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Really?
That's right.
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
When do we
