Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
What crap?
No
I hope so.
Who?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Queen Harry?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
It's just you.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
So they tell me...
Thirty-two.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
He seems like he thrives on danger
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's her favorite band.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Away.
Are you lost?
We're not.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Does it matter?
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Who?
Oh, right.  Friday.
I told you
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Something like that
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
Because you're making decisions for me.
So what I want doesn't matter?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Just smack her now.
Yeah.  I guess.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Dr. Ruth?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Your life, and that of others!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I find that hard to believe.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I am busy inside.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I'm not bargaining!
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
He understands.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Damn God!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
Give me absolution.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
My horse doesn't work.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?
What about Oleg?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Give me another one, please.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
Yes, I considered it.
I'll get my clothes.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
But Chief?  Over this??
Vodka tonic.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Nah, why should you?
Pretty.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Of course.
Something back home?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
I'm not.
You're ruthless.
See you later.  Good luck.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
I'm not moody.
Keep them out of my way.
No.  Are you proposing?
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
You'll be my first.
Two weeks holiday.
Is there a problem?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Cut!
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Excuse me?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay, come on down.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
In three days, darling, I hope.
She's in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
Thank you, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Yes, very pleasant.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hammond.
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Must be billy's girl.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You sure that's the reason?
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Partnership?
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
I didn't have the time.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I'm heading out. How about you?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
You're hopeless.
I guess he got the message...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Hiya, kid.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Where is he?
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
First, the money.
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Five bills.
This ain't a credit business.
Napoleon... small.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
So you do know her.
She's an exception..
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
They are... with me...
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
He's on vacation.
Not without Leeloo.
What mission?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
What is it?
Three of us will never fit in there!
Uh..you're welcome.
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
OK, you can turn around!
...The rain falls...
Exactly.
I love you...
Been here long?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Actually only one cell survived..
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Recommendations.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know what to say
Amy...
There's nothing harder.
What can I do for you today?
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Where are the women?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
We do.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Eddie.
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Stop talking.
Show me where you buried her.
Don't think I won't.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Fuck you.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Yeah... guess so.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Three, four years.
Max.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Where does he sell it?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Nope.
I try to be.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
You're joking.
I'm here.
Yes, but...
Neil... Neil Cole.
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
What?
It's been six years.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
What?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Oh God!  He killed them!
You're not taking my baby!
No...
Who said I...wait, what?
He's inside you, where he hides.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
To take a picture.
Sobering...
I've got to go.
But Dad --
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
Well we gotta do something!
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Stick around, please?
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Something wrong?
What????
What about time...?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
What?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Toward the Pole!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Twombley involved?
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You can't buy Wade off.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Oh.
Sun's gettin high.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
What blood?
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
No.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Hi honey.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Yeah. I mean that.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
How's that?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Where... how'd you hear that?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
His office. You mean my old office.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Huh?
How was she?
Who?
Yeah, I guess.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
What about her?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Well, I never heard that one.
Wade, are you alright?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Some kids were teasing you?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
I'm doing what I can.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Lemme take a look.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
To swear you in as President.
Because it is my duty.
Dead.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Copy, Air Force One.
Thank you.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I know he left you behind.
That was war.
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Over my dead body.
You'll do it?
Excuse me?
But...
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
I might still have a few chips left.
That's my job.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
Accelerators down.
Sir?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ask Simon.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, please be careful.
Not now, Elaine.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Scraps.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Yes.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I can't tell.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Yes. Yes, of course.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
But if you'll just give me...
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Yes, Captain?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Thank you.
No. No thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Would you go up, please?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
The human?
Yeah, I'll bet.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Whatever gave you that idea?
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
How long until it blows?
What?
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Sir?
Alive?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
On my way.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Uh, what's next?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
No.. I've slept enough.
They're dead.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Look!
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
A brothel.
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Em iram! Em iram!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, ask her!
Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
You'd think I was mad.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
What?
I was at hand.
Leave him alone!
Adorable!
Hey!
Ah-ha!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Yes, Sire.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well. There it is.
He's here.
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
No one calls you that.
Good morning, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Can I see it?
Well, we can.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Did you like it, then?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Filled?
